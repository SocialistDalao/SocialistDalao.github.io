</p><p>and not.
</p><p>Talk to the world.
</p><p>Listen to the world.
</p><p>Might some time act like a fool
</p><p>or thought to be good.
</p><p>Might act same.
</p><p>Might act different.
</p><p>But that isn't what I should care.
</p><p>Talk, and represent the true self to everyone.
</p><p>Expression, feelings and thoughts.
</p><p>What creates me is what is worth being given to the world.
</p><p>Keep open, stay true.</p>
